<p>If you see a University of Maryland student walking around campus, chances are they are a small business owner.</p>

<p>Many students have transformed their hobbies and passions into profitable businesses. This has been done out of different motivations, such as a desire to share their creations with like-minded individuals, boredom, or simply to earn an income while still in college.</p>

<p>These businesses provide fashion items like clothing and bags, digital art and even photography, which have garnered support and patronage from both peers and faculty members.</p> 

<p><strong>Cordeaux A</strong>
<p>During a trip to Cameroon, sophomore information science major Astrid Tagne birthed a bag business from seeing her family member’s bag.</p>

<p>She was so fascinated that she had to get her hands on the bag, which led to the start of Cordeaux A– a bag business that honors her Cameroonian culture and is sourced and hand-crafted in Cameroon.</p>

<p>Tagne, who always wanted to start a business, did not necessarily think her business would revolve around a bag. She took the opportunity because it presented itself.<p>

<p>“I didn’t know it was going to be a bag particularly,” Tagne said. I always knew I wanted to start something.”</p>

<p>The bags are created by Cameroonian artisans whom her family friend connected her to. They are made of leather and raffia–a palm tree fiber. The bags also come in a variety of colors and shapes. Some are even made in the shape of her cultural drums.</p> 
<p>Once the bags are shipped to the United States, she markets the bags at campus pop-ups, Mercari, and at student organizations catered to students of color. The bags are priced at $100.</p>

<p>Tagne hopes anyone who purchases her bags appreciate the beauty and see the value of Cameroonian artisans.</p>

<p>“My overall goal is for the people of Cameroon to be seen as the creators that they are,” Tagne said.</p> 

<p><strong>SaintLamarr</strong>
<p>As a child, Ed-Lamarr Petion immersed himself in comic books and would create fictional words all day with his siblings, so it is no surprise that he now makes digital art that looks like comic book characters.</p>

<p>“I would pick up a comic book and get lost,” Petion, a senior marketing and supply chain management major, said. “It was like my world.”</p>

<p>Petion often draws public figures, characters from TV shows, movies and comic books, which he offers through his business, <a href= "https://www.saintlamarr.com/"> SaintLamarr</a>.</p>

<p>He has drawn Kanye West, Bob Marley, Simone Biles, Afro Samurai, and even cartoon characters from Scooby-Doo, Adventure Time and Total Drama Island among others.</p>

<p>His drawing process entails listening to music, researching the background of who he is drawing and scrolling through Instagram and Pinterest for inspiration.</p>

<p>“Half of my photos are just screenshots of artists I like,” Petion said. “Art itself is just kind of the regurgitation of previous art. It’s about how you can take something and make it better or transfigure it in some way shape or form.”</p>

<p>His art pieces also include easter eggs that allude to a character’s identity as well as a playful use of colors and emotion.</p>

<p>Petion takes commissions and sells his pieces at art conventions and pop-up events on campus. He hopes people like what they see and are also inspired to follow their passions.</p>

<p>Nnnena Elekalachi created her streetwear clothing brand, <a href= "https://elevatedapparel.co/">Elevated Apparel</a>, out of boredom.</p> 

<p>“I got bored and I’m like okay, ‘what’s the new venture,’” Elekalachi, a junior immersive media design and information science major, said.</p> 

<p>While scrolling through social media in 2020, she was inspired by the many clothing businesses she saw, so she decided she too could sell clothing and hop on the trend.</p>

<p>She sells T-shirts and even tote bags, which take inspiration from the christian Bible. Most of her products have quotes from the Bible written on it.</p>

<p>She also has a photography business, which all started when she photographed models for her clothing brand’s shoot. She noticed her hidden talent was taking pictures, so she decided to pursue it.</p>

<p>“Photography is fun and it’s something that’s not that hard to learn for me. You just do research. I watched videos and made sure I got the right equipment,” Elekalachi said.</p> 

<p>Elekalachi said the African community on campus mostly supports her photography and clothing brand, and she is thankful for them.</p>
