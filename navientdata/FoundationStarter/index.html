<p>I found the Navient Lawsuit interesting because it was fascinating to see how large corporations take advantage of the community they claim to help. After reading the article on <a href="https://www.studentloanplanner.com/navient-lawsuit-updates/" target="_blank">Student Loan Planner</a>, it made me understand the lawsuit and why the company was sued. Initially, I was confused, but after reading the article a couple of times, I understood better.</p>

<p>As I looked through the data on the <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/search/?chartType=line&dateInterval=Month&dateRange=3y&date_received_max=2024-05-07&date_received_min=2021-05-07&lens=Product&searchField=all&subLens=sub_product&tab=Trends/"target="_blank">Consumer Complaint Database</a>, I decided to compare complaint data from Maryland and Massachusetts. Both have similar populations, making them suitable states to compare and contrast. Marylandâ€™s population is 6,180,253 according to the U.S. Census Bureau while Massachusetts's population has a population of 7,001,399 according to the Bureau.</p> 

<p>To narrow down my search on the database and help with lowering numbers(the high numbers can be overwhelming), I decided to compare student loan complaints between the two states from 2012-2024.The graph below shows the complaints per year for Maryland and Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The Consumer Finacial Protection Bureau filed its lawsuit against Navient in 2017, hence why Maryland and Massachusetts had the highest number of complaints in 2017. Maryland had 476 complaints while Massachusetts had 456 complaints. There is a difference of 20 complaints between both states. Maryland saw an 83% increase in complaints from 2016 to 2017 while Massachusetts also saw a substantial increase in complaints. It saw a 113% increase in complaints from 2016 to 2017.</p>

<p>Comparing the year in which the lawsuit was filed(2017) to now(2024), the complaints Maryland received declined by 68%. The complaints Massachusetts also received declined by 52%. It seems that after the company was sued and had to repay borrowers, they became more cautious to avoid a similar situation in the future. As a result, they likely became more attentive to borrower needs and worked to ensure that their customers were satisfied. This could be why there has been a significant decrease in complaints from 2017 to 2024.</p>

<p>I also compared federal student loan complaints against Navient per state. The data for federal student loan complaints was the only type of consistent loan complaint between both states from the years 2017 to 2024. So the graph below looks at a comparison of the number of federal student loan complaints per state from 2017 to 2024.</p>

The years that stand out from the chart are 2017 and 2023. In 2017, Maryland received 296 complaints while Massachusetts received fewer complaints at 245 complaints. In 2023, Maryland received 267 complaints while Massachusetts received 311 complaints. Overall when looking at the chart, Maryland received more complaints from 2017 to 2019 while Massachusetts received more complaints from 2020 to 2024.
